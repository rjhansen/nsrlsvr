Installation instructions:

1.  Decide what data set you want nsrlsvr to query against by
    default.  Your options are:
    
    a.  NIST's NSRL RDS (http://http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/).
    
    b.  A dataset that you provide at compile-time.  For instance,
        if you have a proprietary set of SHA-1 hashes of known 
        malware and know you'll only ever want to use that, this is
        the way to go.  

    You may also tell nsrlsvr to use a different file by passing the
    "-f" flag when launching the server.  This file must contain nothing
    but MD5, SHA-1 or SHA-256 hashes, one per line in hexadecimal format,
    with no other content on a line.  This option is mostly for developer
    testing: most users will never touch it.


2.  If you're compiling it using your own dataset, your dataset must
    be in a format nsrlsvr understands.  One good way to do this is with 
    Jesse Kornblum's md5deep tool:

    $ md5deep -rco f [FILES] > my_dataset.txt

    
3.  Run the ./configure script, passing it one or more of:

    a.  No options: if the current RDS zipfile exists in the build
        directory, use that; otherwise, try to download it.
    b.  --with-custom=my_set.txt: use your own dataset
    c.  --with-nsrl=filename: use an already-downloaded NSRL RDS
        zip file (one that lives, e.g., outside the build dir).
        You will want to use this option if a newer NSRL RDS has
        been released than the one nsrlsvr knows about.


4.  Once you've completed the "make && make install" dance, an
    executable will be installed to $PREFIX/bin: nsrlsvr, the server
    application, which runs as a UNIX daemon.


5.  As an example of how it can be used:

    $ md5deep -rco f /path/to/evil/files > evil_dataset.txt
    $ ./configure --with-custom=evil_dataset.txt
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    
    You've now created a custom dataset that contains MD5 hashes
    of files you've declared to be evil.
    
    $ nsrlsvr -t 1800
    
    You've started the server and instructed it to automatically
    shut down after a half-hour of inactivity.
